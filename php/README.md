# PHP Samples for the Content API for Shopping

For more information on the API, please refer to
[the documentation](https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/).
The [Installed application flow](https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/v2/how-tos/authorizing)
is used for authentication in the PHP samples.


These samples require the PHP client library. Please see the following
[installation instructions](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/php/start/installation).

The samples are command-line applications and require you to create a file
called `.shopping-content-samples.json` in your home directory. You can use the
`config.json` file here as a template.
